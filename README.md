# LED

#### Project Overview

The LED project demonstrates how to control an LED connected to an Arduino Mega. LEDs are fundamental components in electronics and are widely used for visual indications. This project utilizes the Arduino to turn the LED on and off at specified intervals, showcasing basic digital output control.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **LED (any color)**
- **Resistor (appropriate value for the LED, typically 220 ohms)**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the LED to Arduino Mega:**
   - **LED Anode (Longer Leg)**: Connect to digital pin 13 (or any other digital pin)
   - **LED Cathode (Shorter Leg)**: Connect to GND through a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220 ohms)

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the LED and resistor as per the connection diagram provided.
   - Ensure the resistor limits the current to the LED to prevent damage.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - The LED should turn on for 1 second and then turn off, repeating this cycle indefinitely.

#### Applications

- **Visual Indication:** Use LEDs to provide status indicators in various projects.
- **Basic Output Control:** Learn fundamental digital output control using Arduino.
- **Prototyping:** Essential for prototyping circuits and testing digital outputs.

#### Notes

- **Resistor Value:** Choose an appropriate resistor value to protect the LED from excess current.
- **LED Polarity:** Ensure correct polarity when connecting the LED (anode to positive, cathode to negative).
- **Expansion:** Experiment with different digital pins and modify the code to control multiple LEDs or vary the blink pattern.
